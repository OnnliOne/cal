# Base App - App Store CLI

It contains the boiler plate code for a new app. There is a one time copying of files right now.

You can read details of how exactly the CLI uses this base app [here](../../app-store-cli/README.md).

## TODO

- Rename it _baseApp to convey very clearly that it is not an actual app.
